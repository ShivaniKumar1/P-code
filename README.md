# P-code

# Goal:
Me and my colleague, Nicole Freites, wrote a virtual machine designed to execute p-code or the assembly language of a CPU.
# How To:

To compile code from command line:
gcc P-machine.c

To run the program:
./a.out INSERT_FILENAME_HERE.txt
- Make sure you insert your preferred input.txt file where it says INSERT_FILENAME_HERE.txt

The output will print directly to the terminal.

If there is a comment, starting with /*, that has no end */, then nothing will print.
